## Abstract - 1

The ATOX Ecosystem is home to the [ATOX Token](atox-ecosystem/a-roadmap-for-the-atox-ecosystem/what-is-atox/atox-token.md) which is a protocol with Decentralised financing that can be implemented on any smart contract-enabled blockchain. It has been built and lives at atoxscan.com and is also attached to Binance Smart Chain(BSC) and Polygon (MATIC) while development continues on [atoxscan](atox-ecosystem/a-roadmap-for-the-atox-ecosystem/what-is-atox/what-atox-has-planned./atoxscan.md). Designed with maximum usage facilities for the community, and can be used as a fuel for innumerable online payment services as shown in our roadmap.

The project has been designed by the ATOX developers to ensure maximum security, and guarantee a better more stable reward system by using the ATOX, Everything from Staking, Winning and Building crypto related Dapps on the ATOX Ecosystem will be possible, on our mobile app while earning ATOX-LP Tokens from the  [atoxFarm](atox-ecosystem/a-roadmap-for-the-atox-ecosystem/what-is-atox/what-atox-has-planned./atoxswap/atoxfarm/) for maximum potential earning up to 28% API. Our user interface will put you to ease to trade numerous coins without moving assets from centralised exchanges, paying fees left right and centre, using features like my ATOX wallet which is a decentralised wallet meaning you are still in control of your all assets. 100% of the time!

Our roadmap, token distribution are clearly defined so investors can have the utmost confidence in the project. The token is here to stay, to help bring the final solution to making the world a better place. See how we aim to achieve this in the [Project Goals](atox-ecosystem/a-roadmap-for-the-atox-ecosystem/project-goals.md).

We want the ATOX Ecosystem community to attain maximum financial freedom. As a result of this, every ATOX holder is incentivized to spread the use of ATOX as much as possible. As the platform gains more traction and more transactions take place on the network, the token will benefit from an increased exposure, which would ultimately benefit the community in the long run. The ATOX Ecosystem plans to be around for many years to come!

## Introduction - 2

Technology and digital transformation has helped propel the world into a new era of technological advancement. An era where the materiality of money will cease to exist and the newer cryptocurrency asset class will hover on the horizons of finance.

The current decade of the 21st century has seen much advancement, improvement, and progress in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. This has led to the creation of several blockchain-based projects across various industries, with the goal of tackling some of the problems plaguing humanity. The project was created to solve real-world issues while also benefiting investors by including various options to solve many different problems.

Our Solution:

Donating to one or more in organisation

Charity Program&#x20;

Better Off Program

ATOX Career Program&#x20;

atoxswap jobs



Unlike the Ethereum network, the Binance Smart Chain, or even Polygonâ€¦

[atoxscan](atox-ecosystem/a-roadmap-for-the-atox-ecosystem/what-is-atox/what-atox-has-planned./atoxscan.md) has made the right adjustments needed to allow transactions to be conducted much faster and for a small fraction of the cost but this is now raising too so a solution is [ATOX](atox-ecosystem/a-roadmap-for-the-atox-ecosystem/what-is-atox/).

## Why choose ATOX ? - 3

The previous few years were no doubt an eventful few years for the whole of humanity really.&#x20;

The pandemic has disrupted the normal lives of millions of people around the world particularly in developing economies.&#x20;

At a time like this, ATOX aims to contribute to social good by helping people who hold our Token in our ecosystem.&#x20;

The platform will raise funds to support various causes through donations to charities or other in need organisations as well as having a couple inhouse solutions by creating the ATOX charity program, Better Off Program, while having atoxswap jobs platform to help the ATOX career program with will provide thousands of new jobs in result to help to on going issues with unemployment.



For every burn conducted on the ecosystem:

28% to the charity reserve program.&#x20;

15% to one or more in need organisations. &#x20;

10% to the Better Off Program.&#x20;

10% to the ATOX career program.

5% to atoxswap jobs



This is our attempt to give back and try to make the world a better place. Through our roadmap you can see our goals and see the plans we have to make that possible.

&#x20;We will aim to help the community and experienced traders get the best user experience while trading with next to nothing fees. Making the best return on investments in a century!&#x20;

We hopefully can achieve this by completing all 9 phases. We have planned for a fixed development process where we have used a smart contract and called it : `ATOX_Development_Protocol`

&#x20;After the initial launch of Phase 1 the contract will take over and all development will have to hit a certain target for the next development process to start and this will hopefully allow us to carry out a healthy, gradual start to how the project is launched to ensure no damage to early investorsâ€¦&#x20;

We want to be straight to the point when it comes to our community meaning everything from the development progress and just real-world problems that may occur. This is an open-source project and we want our community on board every step of the way!&#x20;

Once the `ATOX_Development_Protocol` contract has completed all 8 phases. The protocol's last task is to launch the ATOX Ecosystems Governance Protocol (DAO) where the community will get a certain percentage voting rights depending on how many ATOX Tokens the user holds and they will determine what happens on the ecosystem.

Currently, itâ€™s difficult to swap tokens without having to pay ungodly fees to exchanges, decentralised or centralised. Even worse, new projects sometimes get labelled scams incorrectly because they lack proper exposure and the right tools necessary for launching a successful project.&#x20;

We will launch our decentralised exchange at app.atoxswap.com to help the community perform token swaps with ease and with next to nothing fees. Token holders will be able to contribute their holdings into the liquidity pools and receive ATOX-LP rewards. Token creators use the exchange to act as a launchpad on info.atoxswap.com for smaller early-stage projects to easily launch their tokens and manage their ICOs using an already established platform.

We will launch our mobile app with a built-in system for everything related to cryptocurrency investment. The app will feature a dashboard where you can easily Swap, Win, Trade and Track tokens in your portfolio.
